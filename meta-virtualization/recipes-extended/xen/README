configuring the hypervisor
--------------------------

Since 4.7.0 Xen supports using Kconfig to configure the hypervisor. Similarly
to how the recipe for busybox works, you can provide a .config as a defconfig
to override the default configuration of the hypervisor. The easiest way
for you to take advantage of this is to create a .config for Xen and then
copy it to your Yocto layer as 'defconfig' inside of
'recipes-extended/xen/files/' and then create a bbappend adding
'file://defconfig' to your SRC_URI.

To generate your own .config file for Xen, you can use the interactive
menuconfig via bitbake:

    bitbake xen -c menuconfig

Select the config settings that you want and Save the file. If you save it to
the default ".config" file when prompted by menuconfig, you can find it in the
'xen' subdirectory of the build tree.

security patches
----------------

The base recipe does not include security fixes that the Xen community releases
as XSAs (http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/). The easiest way to include those is to
drop patches in 'recipes-extened/xen/files' and create a bbappend adding those
patches to SRC_URI and they will be applied. Alternatively, you can override
the SRC_URI to a git repo you provide that contains the patches.

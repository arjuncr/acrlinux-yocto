The roadmap items are broken into the following broad categories:

  - container runtimes
  - hypervisor base support
  - build system / workflow
  - container stacks / management
  - container images / applications / artifacts
  - container base / support components (tools, plugins, etc)

The numbers in () are timeframes for the work to be completed.

Container base packages / support:

  - package refresh (6)

Container "Stacks", with integrated unit or system level testing in meta-virt:

  - base stacks: docker, containerd, podman

  - containerd (nearly done, 6 months)
  - docker (done)
  - podman (nearly done, 6 months)

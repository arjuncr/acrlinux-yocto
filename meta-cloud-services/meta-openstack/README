meta-openstack
===================

This layer provides support for building the packages from the OpenStack project.
The layer contains recipes for the nova, glance, keystone, cinder, quantum, swift
and horizon components.

The bbappend files for some recipes (e.g. postgresql) and preferred version setting
(e.g. python-networkx)in this layer need to have 'openstack' in DISTRO_FEATURES to
have effect. To enable them, add in configuration file the following line.

  DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " openstack"

If meta-openstack is included, but openstack is not enabled as a
distro feature a warning is printed at parse time:

    You have included the meta-openstack layer, but
    'openstack' has not been enabled in your DISTRO_FEATURES. Some bbappend files
    and preferred version setting may not take effect. See the meta-openstack README
    for details on enabling openstack support.

If you know what you are doing, this warning can be disabled by setting the following
variable in your configuration:

  SKIP_META_OPENSTACK_SANITY_CHECK = 1

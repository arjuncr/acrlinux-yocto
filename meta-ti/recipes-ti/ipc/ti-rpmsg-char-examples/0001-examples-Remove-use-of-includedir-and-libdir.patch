Subject: [PATCH] examples: Remove use of includedir and libdir

These point to standard include and library paths which already are used
from sysroot relative paths secondly, they use absolute paths which
means we are asking to add -I/usr/include which might be ok in a native
build but not in cross build. This helps mitigate QA errors found with
OE build system since it finds it adding host include and library search
paths to linker/compiler commandline

All particulars of the Arm Software and its use as described in the Arm Documentation are given by Arm in good faith. Consequently, the information contained in the Arm Documentation is subject to change without notice and is not warranted to be error free. If you discover any errors in the Arm Documentation please report them to Arm in writing. Any Arm Documentation provided to you that relates to specific industry quality and functional safety standard compliance may assist you in applying to a competent auditor for certification of Your Software or Your Hardware, but you acknowledge and agree that on its own such Arm Documentation may not provide sufficient evidence of, or be compatible with, the required safety compliance standards.

7.3 Except as provided in clause 7.1 above, you agree that the Arm Tools are licensed "as is", and that Arm expressly disclaims all representations, warranties, conditions or other terms, express or implied or statutory, including without limitation the implied warranties of non-infringement, satisfactory quality, and fitness for a particular purpose.

8.2 Arm does not seek to limit or exclude liability for death or personal injury arising from Arm's negligence or Arm's fraud.

8.3 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this License, the maximum liability of Arm to you in aggregate (in contract, tort or otherwise) in relation to or in connection with the subject matter of this License shall not exceed the greater of (i) the total sums paid by you to Arm (if any) for this License, and (ii) $10.00 USD. The existence of more than one claim will not enlarge or extend the limit.

11. TERM AND TERMINATION
11.1 Subject to clauses 11.2 and 11.3 below, this License shall remain in force until terminated by you, by Arm or (in the case of a time limited license) by expiry.

11.2 In the event of a party breaching of any of the terms and conditions of this License, which if capable of remedy, has not been remedied by that party within thirty (30) days of the date of breach, without prejudice to any of its other rights under this License, the non-breaching party may terminate this License immediately upon giving written notice to the breaching party. Upon termination of this License by you or by Arm, or upon expiry, you shall (and shall ensure that your Permitted Users shall) immediately (i) stop using the Arm Tools (or any element thereof) and any Confidential Information and, (ii) destroy all copies of the same in your possession or control, together with all Arm Documentation and related materials.

12. GENERAL
12.1 This License is governed by English Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that you are an agency, contractor or instrumentality of the U.S. Government, disputes arising under or relating to this License shall be decided under the U.S. federal law of government contracting, including without limitation the Contract Disputes Act. Nothing in this License shall prevent you from enforcing your intellectual property rights or seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties hereby disclaim application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act.

12.2 Except where Arm agrees otherwise in (i) a written contract signed by you and Arm, or (ii) a written contract provided by Arm and accepted by you, this is the only agreement between you and Arm relating to the Arm Tools and it may only be modified by written agreement between you and Arm. No terms and conditions contained in any purchase order or other document issued by you, or any advertising or other representation by you or any third party shall add to, supersede or in any way vary the terms and conditions of this License. This License (and any documents expressly incorporated into it by reference herein) represents the entire agreement between you and Arm in relation to its subject matter.

12.3 If any clause or sentence in this License is held by a court of law to be illegal or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of this License shall not be affected. Any failure by Arm to enforce any of the provisions of this License, unless waived in writing, shall not constitute a waiver of Arm's rights to enforce such provision or any other provision of this License in the future.

12.4 Subject to clause 10.1(b), neither this License or any rights granted to you under it may be assigned, sub-licensed or otherwise transferred by you to any third party without the prior written consent of Arm. An assignment shall be deemed to include, without limitation (i) any transaction or series of transactions whereby a third party acquires, directly or indirectly, the power to control the management and policies of you, whether through the acquisition of voting securities, by contract or otherwise; and (ii) the sale of more than fifty percent (50%) of your assets whether in a single transaction or series of transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Arm may, in its discretion acting reasonably, separately agree to authorise the re-host of a Licensed Seat (for which additional charges may apply).

Any information which is disclosed to Arm or such auditors during checking or audit shall be treated as your confidential information and shall only be used by Arm for compliance and enforcement purposes.

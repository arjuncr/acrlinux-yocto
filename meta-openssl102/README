meta-openssl102
===============

This layer provides the older OpenSSL 1.0.2.  This alternative version 
can be used as the default OpenSSL if the older version is required for 
some reason.

This alternative version is derived from openembedded-core prior to it's 
removal.


Dependencies
------------
This layer depends on OpenEmbedded-core (meta) layers.


Usage
-----
To enable this version you can add the following to your local.conf or
distribution file:

  PREFERRED_VERSION_openssl = '1.0.2%'

or if you have the wr-template layer, add to WRTEMPLATE feature/openssl102:

  WRTEMPLATE = "feature/openssl102"

or use the template without wr-templarte, add to your local.conf:

  include <path_to_layer>/templates/feature/openssl102/template.conf


Maintenance
-----------
Please see the MAINTAINERS file for information on contacting the maintainers
of this layer, as well as instructions for submitting patches.


Notes
-----
Unlike many layers, maintenance for this layer will always move to the 
latest OpenSSL 1.0.2 version.  If the community does not have necessary 
fixes available, then patches will be added to whatever the latest 
release version is.

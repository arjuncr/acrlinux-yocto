Rocko Release 11/2017
=====================

Moved qat support to separate layer
-----------------------------------
Quick Assist Technology (QAT) is more middleware and should not be part of the
core BSP. The new layer can be found here:
https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/meta-intel-qat/

Moved dpdk support to separate layer
------------------------------------
We had some requests to make DPDK standalone so that it could be included
without bringing in anything else from meta-intel, as it is not specific to
Intel(R) hardware. The new layer is located here:
https://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/meta-dpdk/

Added support for out-of-tree iwlwifi drivers
---------------------------------------------
Backport-iwlwifi out-of-tree wifi modules are now available via meta-intel.
Backport-iwlwifi brings the latest iwlwifi drivers to almost any kernel
Note that mac80211 and cfg80211 backports are also necessary, which will most
likely cause incompatibility with other in-tree wifi drivers.
See https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/drivers/iwlwifi for more info.

Added support for out-of-tree ixgbe drivers
-------------------------------------------
The out-of-tree ixgbe drivers bring ixgbe support to nearly any kernel. See
here: http://www.intel.com/network/connectivity/products/server_adapters.htm

Added an implementation of Secure Boot
--------------------------------------
meta-intel now supports a simple Secure Boot implementation. This implementation
consists of a single binary consisting of an EFI stub, the kernel, an
initrd, and a kernel command line. The binary is then signed via keys defined by
the variables SECUREBOOT_SIGNING_KEY and SECUREBOOT_SIGNING_CERT. These keys
should match the keys embedded in your hardware's firmware.
See documentation/secureboot/README for more information on this feature.

Improved Yocto Project Compatibility status
-------------------------------------------
The common layer should now be considered Yocto Project compatible - it should
no longer modify OE-core values when adding the layer to your bblayers.conf.
The meta-tlk layer is still not Yocto Project compatible, however.

Pyro Release 5/2017
===================

Changed default kernel provider from linux-yocto to linux-intel.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Linux-intel is an Intel(R)-maintained kernel based on the latest stable
branch, along with backports from upstream to better support Intel(R)
hardware. The intel-linux kernel also has a branch with the preempt-rt
patches applied, providing a preempt-rt kernel with no additional work.

Added QEMU support.
-------------------
We now build several virtio drivers into the kernel by default, and
have qemuboot.conf files for intel-corei7-64 and intel-core2-32
targets. This allows one to do basic testing on meta-intel images
without having to use hardware. The virtio drivers are added via
KERNEL_FEATURES_INTEL_COMMON. This prevents them from being added to
custom kernels by default. They can be removed by adding the
following to a conf or kernel bbappend file:
  KERNEL_FEATURES_INTEL_COMMON_remove = “cfg/virtio.scc”
OVMF firmware is also built and can be used in order to emulate a UEFI
environment. A full runqemu command line for intel-corei7-64 could look
like this:
  runqemu core-image-minimal intel-corei7-64 wic ovmf

Musl support
------------
Meta-intel is now compatible with the musl C library. You can specify musl
As your C library by adding the following to your local.conf:
  TCLIBC = “musl”
Note: there is a known failure with DPDK.

X32 support
-----------
The meta-intel layer can now build with the x32 tune settings in a multi-lib
setting, it will not work in as the primary MACHINE tune as the bootloader needs
to be built as a 64bit binary. The setup for this would be as follows:
  require conf/multilib.conf
  MULTILIBS = "multilib:libx32
  DEFAULTTUNE_virtclass-multilib-libx32 = "corei7-64-x32"
